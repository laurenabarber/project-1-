Who: made for followers of my instagram @laurenabarber / people w/ an interest in high fashion (i have over 13.3k on my instagram which is a blog on high fashion)
        
What: fashion blog that allows people to see my up-to-date instagram feed, blog posts, and items I have linked on my LTK account (its a site that instagrammers/bloggers use to save items they like and share it to followers)
        
Where: This site will be for the fashion side of the internet and really just act as a home base for all things that relate to my blog.
        
When: this will be able to be used by my followers immediately to gain additional content in addition to my instagram. There will also be a new blog post once a week.
        
Why: many instagram bloggers create a website to provide additional content they are unable to share on the platform. It also would be a way to drive people who come across the website to visit my instagram, possibly increasing followers.
