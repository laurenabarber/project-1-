I've included an mp3 file of the sound of a subway car screttching as it arrives. there is still a lot to be done with my aup file as its nowhere how i want it to be in the end, but I hope to continue to layer my own sounds to create a final project. I have had some difficulty with space on my computer doing this as i am aditionally in a film class, so once my external hardrive arrives on thursday it should be easier to bring in more audio.
